##  Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikkelgrevy/mechanic-booking-system.git
cd mechanic-booking-system
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure secrets**

Create a `secret.py` file in the root directory:
```python
# secret.py
app_pass = "your-secret-key-here"
admin_pass = "your-admin-password"
totp_pass = "your-totp-secret"  # Generate with: pyotp.random_base32()
```

4. **Initialize the database**
```bash
python app.py
```
The database will be created automatically on first run.

5. **Setup 2FA (first time only)**

Navigate to `/admin_2fa_setup` to generate a QR code for your authenticator app.

6. **Access the application**
- Customer interface: `http://localhost:5000`
- Admin login: `http://localhost:5000/admin_login`

##  Security Features

- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Admin access requires both password and TOTP code
- **Session Management:** Automatic logout after 10 minutes of inactivity
- **Secure Secrets:** Sensitive data stored in non-committed `secret.py` file
- **Input Validation:** Form data validated before database insertion

##  Key Learnings

This project was developed as part of my IT-Technology studies at KEA. Through building it, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Full-stack development:** Integrating frontend, backend, and database
- **Database design:** SQLAlchemy ORM and relational data modeling
- **Authentication:** Implementing TOTP-based 2FA from scratch
- **User experience:** Creating intuitive booking flows
- **Security best practices:** Session management, secret handling, input validation

##  Features in Detail

### Time Slot Management
- Generates hourly slots from 08:00 to 16:00
- Automatically marks booked slots as unavailable
- Shows only next 5 business days
- Prevents double-booking

### Admin Authentication Flow
1. Password authentication
2. TOTP code verification (6-digit code from authenticator app)
3. Time-limited session (10 minutes)

### Database Schema
```sql
Booking
â”œâ”€â”€ id (Primary Key)
â”œâ”€â”€ name (String, 100)
â”œâ”€â”€ email (String, 100)
â”œâ”€â”€ nummerplade (String, 7)  -- License plate
â”œâ”€â”€ telefon (String, 11)      -- Phone number
â”œâ”€â”€ timeslot (String, 20)
â””â”€â”€ date (Date)
```

##  Known Limitations

- Single-shop setup (not multi-location)
- No email notifications for bookings
- Manual booking deletion (no customer cancellation interface)
- Danish language only in templates

##  Future Improvements

- [ ] Email confirmation system
- [ ] Customer cancellation interface
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Calendar view for admin
- [ ] SMS notifications
- [ ] Recurring booking management

##  Project Context

**Type:** School project (IT-Technology, KEA)  
**Team Size:** Group project, solo development  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Role:** Primary developer - responsible for all backend logic, database design, authentication system, and frontend integration
